A little exemple of what you can do with this app.

## Interface:

on the left you can find:
* NPN Transistor
* PNP Transistor
* Vcc
* GND
* Switch - Vcc Generator (ON or OFF)
* BitDisplay - that act like a LED (1 if it is on, 0 othewise)
* Delete - a button to remove components from the project

_to select an item use the numbers on the keyboard_

## How to use it:
* Adding components:
    Once the component to implement is selected just click on the panel and it will add the component, repit until the component isn't needed anymore.

* Connections:
  * For connecting components you need to use the **select** mode, if selected it will display a green circle on the first element to be connected, if clicked the second one will     have the violet circle;
  * To delete a connection just right click on the interested pin

* Moving component:
    Drag the mouse to move a component or if no component is selected then it will move every component (don't worry if lines fade away, it's normal)

## Menu:
* Options
    * you can remove the grid layout if you want, it will be saved but **WARNING**, if you deselect it and move the panel -> all return in a grid layout

## Reminder:

This app is still in developement so contains bugs, please don't make big projects because classes may change and it could affect old savings making them obsolete
